# thegoodmap

An app to help the environmentally concious find their way.

## Basics

This project aims to provide a simple way for you to make your lifestyle more planet friendly, via a map enabling you to find environmentally friendly businesses near you (powered by OpenStreetMap data), and a tips page that provides a number of simple ways to lessen your impact.

### Map

The map currently displays a number of different businesses

* Restaurants that serve vegetarian or vegan food
* Shops that allow you to refill your own containers
* Shops that revolve around selling organic food
* Businesses that attempt to be zero waste
* Shops that sell second hand goods

#### Giving back

You can also add or edit businesses near you, so that other users of the app will be able to find them too -- alongside anyone else that uses OpenStreetMap.
