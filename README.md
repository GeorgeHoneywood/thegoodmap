# thegoodmap

An app to help the environmentally concious find their way.

## Basics

This project aims to provide a simple way for you to make your lifestyle more planet friendly, via a map enabling you to find environmentally friendly buisnesses near you (powered by OpenStreetMap data), and a tips page that provides a number of simple ways to lessen your impact.

### Map

The map currently displays a number of different buisnesses

* Restaurants that serve vegetarian or vegan food
* Shops that allow you to refill your own containers
* Shops that revolve around selling organic food
* Buisnesses that attempt to be zero waste

#### Giving back

You can also add or edit buisnesses near you, so that other users of the app will be able to find them too -- alongside anyone else that uses OpenStreetMap.

## Contributing

If you have any experience with Flutter and fancy giving a helping hand, we are open to PRs.
